üåê Kid Gloves

Program with a gentler touch.


Kid Gloves patches a bunch of JS quirks that potentially throw errors and turns those into warnings. This is intended to be used as a learning tool and for debugging purposes and not meant to monkey patch live production software.

Note: This only aims to patch errors where the alternative outcome is obvious and doesn't change the existing behavior. So while functions like `JSON.parse` commonly error, there is no way to determine an appropriate return value without drastically changing behavior. `document.querySelector` on the other hand, already has a value for when the query fails to match an element and this makes a good alternative to throwing an error.

## Installation:
Stick this url in a script tag just above the code you want to debug `https://unpkg.com/kid-gloves/kid-gloves.js` like so;

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <div></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/kid-gloves/kid-gloves.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.querySelector(new Symbol('div')).innerHTML = 'Hello World';
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Normally this code would error and present a blank page but this runs and the errors are converted into warnings.

Fixes So far:

### Use `new` with `BigInt` and `Symbol`
Using the `new` keyword returns an Object wrapped version of `BigInt` and `Sybmol` while printing a warning to the console recommending to switch to not using it

### Use `Promise`, `Set`, and `Map`
These objects can be called as a constructor without using the `new` keyword and prints a warning

### Missing Map element
Attempting to access a Map element that does not exist prints a warning

### `document.querySelector`
`document.querySelector` returns `null` even when given an invalid query and prints the typical error as a warning

### `document.querySelectorAll`
`document.querySelectorAll` returns an empty `NodeList` even when given an invalid query and prints the typical error as a warning


### `document.getElementById`
`document.getElementById` returns `null` even when given an invalid query and prints the typical error as a warning

### `document.getElementsById`
`document.getElementsById` warns the user of a potential typo and returns `document.querySelectorAll(`\``[id="${String(query)}"]`\``);`

### `document.getElementsByTagName`
`document.getElementsBy(TagName|TagNameNS|ClassName|Name)` returns an empty `HTMLCollection` even when given an invalid query and prints the typical error as a warning

### `Object.create`
Gives a warning if the target prototype is not an object and attempts to coerce it into an object. If coercion fails then return `Object.create(null)`

### `parseFloat`,`parseInt`,`Number.parseFloat`,`Number.parseInt`
Attempts to safely coerce a Symbol into a string before parsing. If parsing fails for any reason it will return NaN.

### Symbol Coercion
Many functions that expect a string will attempt to coerce inputs into strings. The default coercion for Symbol into string throws an error. Many of these have been patched to do a safe coercion from Symbol to String and printing a warning to the console. The typical coercion takes the form of `String(sym.description ?? sym)`

### Object Coercion
Some functions expect an object as input and will throw an error when passed a literal. That error is printed as a warning and the literal will be converted to an object using `Object()`
